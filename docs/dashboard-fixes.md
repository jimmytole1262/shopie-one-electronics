# Dashboard Products Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stock Display Issue
- **Problem**: Stock values were showing as zero for all products in the dashboard
- **Root Cause**: The `validateProductData` function in `lib/api-utils.ts` was not properly mapping the stock field from API responses
- **Solution**: Updated the function to properly parse and include stock values with appropriate fallbacks

### 2. Image Display Issue
- **Problem**: Product images were not displaying properly in the dashboard
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect image path mapping and error handling
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling and logging for image loading failures, ensured correct path to placeholder image

## Code Changes

### 1. In `lib/api-utils.ts`
- Fixed the `validateProductData` function to:
  - Properly include the `stock` field with type conversion
  - Fix field naming to match the expected format in the Product interface
  - Include all necessary fields from the API response
  - Add proper fallbacks for missing values

### 2. In `app/dashboard/products/page.tsx`
- Improved image error handling with logging
- Enhanced stock value parsing to handle different data types
- Added fallback for missing stock values

## Maintenance Tips

1. **API Response Validation**: Always ensure that the `validateProductData` function in `lib/api-utils.ts` properly maps all fields from the API response to match the Product interface.

2. **Type Conversion**: When dealing with numeric fields like `stock` and `price`, always include type conversion and fallbacks:
   ```typescript
   stock: typeof item.stock === 'number' ? item.stock : parseInt(String(item.stock), 10) || 0
   ```

3. **Image Handling**: Always include proper error handling for images with fallbacks to placeholder images:
   ```typescript
   onError={(e) => {
     console.log("Image failed to load:", product.image_url);
     (e.target as HTMLImageElement).src = "/images/product-placeholder.svg";
   }}
   ```
